# âšª NOTES FOR USERS

- Translate your diagrams in a Visio file using Office 365.
- You must edit the file you'd translate to include the suffix "-tr" at the end of the Visio file name. Otherwise, the script will exit and won't proceed. (This will not work on a wrong file.)

- If criteria met, it creates a folder with "_copy" at the end which later will be exported as a copy .vsdx file that holds the translation.

- Once MS Word 365 opens, proceed with the instructions to translate the text and update the TTT.txt file which will be created by the script itself and then gets deleted after exporting the final Visio file.

- It's just about adding the text of TTT.txt to Word, translate it, and then pasting back to the TTT.txt file, and the script does the heavy job on your behalf.

- Thanks for using my solution.
